## Idea
This is a task manager app named(Tasky) that contain:
- Initial UI's & responsive layouts
- Navigation (push/pop) between screens
- State management with Provider
- Forms + validation (in login & add task & update task screens)
- Futures + REST API (CRUD) using HTTP
- Connectivity detection + offline mode handling
- I also used theming + Light/Dark mode 
- In Login screen write any mock valus in fields to continue
